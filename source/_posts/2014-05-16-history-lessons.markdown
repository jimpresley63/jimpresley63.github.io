For many years I've enjoyed history and reflecting on what things must have been
like for people in other places and times. Some of our favorite family trips
have been immersive historical experiences in places like Williamsburg, Virginia
or New Salem, Illinois where characters in costume recreate times long since
past. {% img right /images/williamsburg2.png Williamsburg %} Perhaps a result of that predisposition, along with my 30th anniversary as
an IT professional, I  have taken time to pause to think about the history of IT
and where it is headed.

Despite the relative short history of IT, it is not difficult to spot cycles and
trends.  For example, in the late 80's and early 90's, I had an opportunity to
work with  a **small Silicon Valley start-up company, Go Corporation, as they
tried to bring mobile tablet computers to market that featured a gesture-based
user experience and handwriting recognition.** The vision was clear but
unfortunately the technology was not quite up to the task. **It took another
20 years before screen, battery, processor, and wireless technology would enable
the shift from desktop to mobile first computing to begin.**

Similarly, in the late 90's, rich graphical user interfaces powered by desktop
computers promised a greatly improved user experience. I helped to build a state
of the art technical **framework in Smalltalk that enabled complex MVC
applications to be built.** It featured sophisticated event handling allowing
data binding between the model and view layer. It was network aware and allowed
applications to be deployed to the server with changes automatically pulled down
to the client. **Sound a little like a rich SPA browser app?** Again, the
limitations of client hardware and the  proprietary nature of fat-client
languages and tools ultimately led to the web becoming the preferred mechanism
for building business applications. **Now 15 years later, JavaScript frameworks are
maturing that leverage many of the same concepts albeit much more robust
implementations.**

These two examples show how **technology will cycle as it moves forward.** Visionary
concepts gain intellectual traction but do not always pass the technological
readiness test and are discarded. It doesn't mean the idea was bad just not
compatible contextually with that time and place. It is important to learn from
history so we are not doomed to repeat it. **Unfortunately, sometimes people take
this to mean that a failed attempt should become a new "law" of IT practice.** As an
archtITioner be careful what you learn from failure. Consider the entire context
and question every assumption you make. **Old discarded ideas may be good fodder for
tomorrow's innovation.**
