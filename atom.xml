    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given that I am a software developer first and foremost, I figured my first blog
post here should be titled &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re reading this, I&rsquo;ve already
felt that special god-like feeling we geeks receive when technology submits to our
will and we see the desired result on the display.  Yes!</p>

<p>A little about me. I began coding some 37+ years ago. I love learning and figuring
out new things. Technology and software engineering have definitely fed my hunger
to continually explore and grow. I strive for excellence which has led me on a
journey adding broader and broader skills and responsibilities. As I went from
developing to designing to architecture, I found out how much I enjoyed working
with others who shared my passion and helping them learn and grow as I have.</p>

<p>Which leads me to this blog today. If you share my joy of coding, designing,
and architecting software and building, growing, and leading teams, I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy
at least some of what I share.</p>

<p>Hello world! Thanks for stopping by. Let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
